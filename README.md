* As the user, I need to be able to see a list of all flavors, and I need to be able to see a list of all treats.
* As the user, I need to be able to select a flavor, see it's details, and see a list of all of the treats that flavor is assigned to. I also need to be able to select a treat, see it's details, and see a list of all flavors it's assigned to as well.
* As the user, I need to add new flavors to our system when they are added. I also need to add new treats to our system when they are added to Pierre's menu.
* As a logged-in user, I need to be able to add, edit, or remove treats that a specific flavor is assigned to. I also need to be able to modify this relationship from the other side, and add or remove flavors from a specific treat.
* I should be able to navigate to a splash page that lists all flavors and treats. Users should be able to click on an individual flavor or treat to see all the flavors/treats that belong to it.
