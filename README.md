4. Navigate to the cloned project folder and open VS code.
```
$ cd Desktop
$ cd [known directory]

#### **AppSettings/Database Connection Setup**
1. Create a new file in the "AnimalShelter.Solution/AnimalShelter" directory named appsettings.json

```
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=firstname_lastname_animalShelter;uid=root;pwd=epicodus;"

#### **Import Database with Entity Framework Core**
1. Navigate to the "AnimalShelter.Solution/AnimalShelter" directory using your terminal.
2. Run the command 'dotnet ef database update to generate the database through Entity Framework Core.
3. (Optional) To update the database with any changes to the code, run the command 'dotnet ef migrations add [MigrationsName] which will use Entity Framework Core's code-first principle to generate a database update.
